    "Milestone 2: Your team is planning to migrate to the cloud. AWS gave 400$ (100$ each) to your team to support this. As part of this initiative, your team needs to set up a server in the cloud, a collaborative environment for your team, and later move your data to the cloud. After that, your team can wrangle the data in preparation for machine learning.\n",

    "    - Move the data that you wrangled in your last milestone to S3.\n",

    "    - Get the data from S3 in your notebook and make data ready for machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Everything in this milestone is to be completed in sequential order. But if you want to divide the tasks, you can ask a team member to work on Task 2 (```4. Get the data that we wrangled in our first milestone.``` and ```6. Wrangle the data in preparation for machine learning```) locally on their laptop while the other members set up the infrastructure (EC2, S3) and TLJH in the cloud. This way, you can move quick.\n",
    "\n",
    "_***Outside of Milestone:*** I strongly recommend you spin up your own instance and experiment with the s3 bucket in doing something (there are many things that we learned and practical work from video series) to get comfortable with AWS. But we won't be looking at it for a grading purpose._"
