## Introduction

This is a team project involving big data. The purpose is to get exposure to working with much larger datasets than we have previously in MDS. We will be building and deploying ensemble machine learning models in the cloud to predict daily rainfall in Australia on a large dataset (~6 GB), where features are outputs of different climate models, and the target is the actual rainfall observation.

We will be using this dataset on [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681). This folder has the output of different climate models as features, and our ultimate goal is to build an ensemble model on these outputs and compare the results with the actual rainfall. At the end of the project, we will have our ML model deployed in the cloud for others to use.
